I'm Michael, and I do all manner of things within the realm of data science.  Here you'll find source code for modeling, packages, general programming, and various other things.


### Projects



I just published a book in summer 2025 called Models Demystified. Check it out in print at [CRC Press](https://www.routledge.com/Models-Demystified-A-Practical-Guide-from-Linear-Regression-to-Deep-Learning/Clark-Berry/p/book/9781032582580) or on my [website](https://m-clark.github.io/book-of-models).

### Skills

Most of my work is in statistical modeling, machine learning, and in particular, forecasting and causal inference. I also do a lot of work with data visualization and data science in general. 


I work primarily in Python these days, but still use R from time to time, and Stan for Bayesian modeling. Most of what you see here is R because that was what I primarily used in academia, and most of my industry work is not public. I also have experience with other tools like SQL and I work with cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, Snowflake, and Azure when projects require it.

### Experience

I am currently a Senior Machine Learning Scientist at OneSix Solutions, where I lead modeling efforts for major firms across healthcare, real estate, and other sectors. Some recent work includes using causal inference in a Bayesian framework to optimize marketing spend, and forecasting in healthcare and insurance settings.

Previously I worked in academia for a number of years, where I did statistical consulting and modeling for faculty and students, most recently at the University of Michigan. In that capacity I have also taught courses and workshops in statistics, data science, and programming. <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m-clark/m-clark/master/img/M.png" alt="M" style="vertical-align:middle; height:1em;">
