Howdy! I'm Michael, and I work primarily with R doing all manner of things with statistics and data science at [CSCAR](https://cscar.research.umich.edu/), at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/).  Here you'll find source code for workshops, packages posts, and various other things.  Find out more about me [here](https://m-clark.github.io)!
